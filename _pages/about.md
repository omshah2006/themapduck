My name is Om and I am a student from Seattle, Washington. I am a big time lover of maps and map infographics. This website explores how big data and maps can be combined to unlock new insights into our world. 

The process for the maps that I make for the sake of learning cartography will likely be displayed in the [blog](/themapduck/blog/) section. A portfolio of all my work will be in the [projects](/themapduck/projects/) section. 

Outside of my mapping enthusiasm, I research interesting applications of machine learning in social sciences, clinical technology, and biomedical computer vision. Email me if you are interested in connecting!
